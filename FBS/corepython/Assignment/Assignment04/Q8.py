### WAP to find which numbers are divisible by 7 and multiple of 5 in a given range.
num1 = int(input("Enter the starting number:"))
num2 = int(input("Enter the ending number:"))

for i in range(num1, num2 + 1):
    if(i % 7 == 0 and i % 5 == 0):
        print(i,end=",")

print('All the number are divisible by 7 and multiple of 5.')
